## The Context

This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Specializations Year at ALX Software Engineering. We chose the problem of time management because itâ€™s critical for success, both in personal and professional contexts. FocusFlow was built to address this challenge and offer users an intuitive platform to improve productivity.

## The Team

We are ALX Software Engineering learners who connected through the program and now have built a strong network of peers!
